        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="overview">
          Movies are a top choice for relaxation and entertainment. Movies
          affect many of us powerfully because the combined impact of images,
          music, dialogue, lighting, sound, and special effects can elicit deep
          feelings and help us reflect on our lives. Cinemas give us this
          experience in the most awesome way possible by providing HD screen
          quality, premium sounds, and SNACKS! Even when watching movies on our
          TVs and Laptops at home, movie snacks make the movie viewing
          experience more enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p class="overview">
          The queues to get snacks at concession lines are stressful and with
          the current pandemic going on, it is also very hard to practice social
          distancing when lots of people are gathering at a particular point.
          These long lines have even caused some people to miss part of their
          movie or they have to start the movie without snacks and return to get
          their snacks. These are all big-time mood killers.
        </p>
        <p class="overview">
          Imagine having to miss the iconic opening scene in Dark Knight because
          you were still stuck on the snack line.

        <h2>My Design Process</h2>
        <p class="overview">
          I utilize the design thinking framework because it provides a way to
          create solutions that address real user problems, are functional, and
          also affordable. It is also nonlinear so it provides great flexibility
          for me as a designer.

        <div>
          <h2>Empathize Phase</h2>
          <p class="overview">
            How can I claim to create a user-centered product if I don’t know
            what the users want? I carried extensive foundational research
            before even thinking of designing anything to answer questions like;
            what should I build? what are the user problems? and how can I solve
            them?
          </p>
          <p class="overview">
            I did some secondary research to get information on what products
            are out there solving similar problems I want to solve. This was a
            sort of competitive auditing to check out the competition so I can
            learn from and also improve on that product. Everyone loves to go to
            the movies, from teens to parents going with their kids. Working
            with a large demographic on such a tight budget was very tough too.
          </p>
          <h3>Primary Research - User Interviews</h3>
          <p class="overview">
            Empathy is a key part of UX research because it helps us designers
            understand someone else’s feelings or thoughts and it helps me get
            rid of cognitive BIAS in my research. I started my research with a
            screener survey shared through my social media accounts to help me
            identify potential participants that meet the requirements of my
            study.
          </p>
          <figure class="single-images">
            <img src="/Screener%20image.4f47e459.png" alt="Screener Screenshot">
            <figcaption>fig.2: Screenshot of screener survey</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p class="overview">
            After identifying and recruiting interview participants, I carried
            out user interviews remotely through the help of online calls and
            documented the results of my interview (i can't share for privacy
            reasons). Some common problems identified include snacks taking too
            long to prepare and snacks finishing too fast. I prioritized
            qualitative research for this project, unlike my last case study
            where I had more quantitative research. The reason for this is
            because I did not have a product (MVP even) at this point and I
            needed to know what users wanted and why?
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
          <p class="overview">
            After evaluating the results from my user interview, I was able to
            mentally sort my users into two different user groups and so I
            designed an aggregated empathy map to visually represent everything
            I have learned about these user groups.
          </p>

          <p class="overview">
            With these empathy maps, I was able to understand the goals and
            characteristics of these groups and create identities that represent
            the needs of a larger group of users. These are my……………………………

          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <p class="overview">
            Say hi to Chisom, a data analyst, and a mother. While she loves her
            job, she also loves to spend time with her family. She plans weekly
            family movie nights and getting snacks is usually a hassle for
            Chisom.

            I want to be able to order snacks to be delivered or picked up so
            that I can host family movie nights without the stress of making
            snacks for my child and husband.
          </p>
          <p class="overview">
            Benjamin, on the other hand, has no major obligations to anyone but
            himself lol. He just wants to watch all the movies coming through
            the MCU Universe this year and with the MCU runtimes getting longer
            and longer, lots of snacks are a must.

            These are illustrations I made to show what Chisom and Ben go

          <h2>Define and Ideate Phase</h2>
          <p class="overview">
            In the Define phase gathered all the information gotten from the
            Empathize phase to define the problems I’m trying to solve and
            kickstart the ideation process. The major part of this phase is
            defining my problem statement. Using the “5 Ws and H” method, I came
            up with problem statements from Ben and Chisom’s POV.
          </p>
          <br>
          <q class="overview"><em>Chisom is a working mother who needs access to snack ordering
              facilities so that she can plan Family movie nights from her
              workplace as she has no time to go the store or make the snacks
              herself.</em></q>
          <br>
          <br>
          <q class="overview"><em>Benjamin is a computer science student who would love to order a
              variety of snacks ahead of his movie from home while getting
              discounts/freebies so he can get more value for his money.</em></q>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="overview">
            Now that I have established our problem statements, I can kick off
            the ideate phase. In this phase, I decided to brainstorm and
            generate ideas, then go on to narrow these ideas down to feasible,
            viable, and desirable solutions.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="overview">
            I then determined the value proposition for my product as this is
            the reason users would be willing to use my product as opposed to
            other products out there. Like the
            <strong>Von Restorff</strong> effects (isolation effect) states:
          </p>
          <br>
          <q class="overview"><em>When multiple homogeneous stimuli are presented, the stimulus
              that differs from the rest is more likely to be remembered.</em></q>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="overview">
            This just means that when multiple, similar objects are present, the
            one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.

            I created a lo-fi prototype to test out with users before going on
            to create the Hi-fi prototype. This is because, unlike my last case
            study which was the redesign of WhatsApp, this is an entirely new
            product and the brand identity hasn’t been set yet. I wanted to
            focus on function rather than aesthetics at this point. You can

          <h3>Usability Studies</h3>
          <p class="overview">
            I carried out usability studies on 3 participants to locate pain
            points in the app and while the participants found it easy to
            navigate the prototype, areas needing improvement were noticed. For
            example, one of the users asked how he would know if the snack has
            been added to the bag without always checking?
          </p>
          <p class="overview">
            I fixed that in the HI-FI prototype by including a small box that
            pops up to notify the user of the successful addition.

            dark mode, it would be much more bearable to other movie watchers.

            I chose the <strong>OPEN SANS</strong> font family because it was
            modern, legible, and minimal. With also a high contrast ratio for
            accessibility reasons.

          <h3>The Onboarding</h3>
          <p class="overview">
            First, the onboarding process which gives the users a quick rundown
            of the product. Users also have the option to skip and get to
            shopping as fast as possible.

          <h3>The Home Page</h3>
          <p class="overview">
            The design is simple and purely intuitive so users can perform the
            tasks they need to do quickly. I also took a page from the Dodo
            pizza app in categorizing the snacks so users can find what they are
            looking for easily. There is also the option of searching for the
            desired snack and adding it to the bag. There is a reward for users
            to complete their first order as seen on the home page and this is a
            psychological move to motivate users to order something. Adding the
            snacks to the tray is also very simple and straightforward. Users
            can edit the ingredients and number of that particular snack in the
            tray.
          </p>

          <h3>The Snack Bag</h3>
          <p class="overview">
            This is the star here, <strong>OBVIOUSLY!!! LOL.</strong> Users can
            add as many snacks as they want and go to the snack bag to either
            edit their order or move ahead with payment. Users also have the
            option of calling to complete their order or even order from scratch
            for those who are non-tech savvy. Users also have three options when
            checking out depending on whether they are ordering ahead of the
            movie, ordering to be delivered at home, or ordering from the Cinema
            auditorium. The <em>“call to order”</em> feature is not available to
            those who want to order from the auditorium though to prevent
            disturbances to other movie watchers.

          <h3>Orders and Profile Page</h3>
          <p class="overview">
            Orders can be viewed and tracked from the orders page which can be
            accessed from the home page at the top right-hand corner of the
            screen. The profile page is very simple and straightforward to avoid
            distractions. Default delivery details can be set here to avoid
            repetition in inputting the details.

          <p class="overview">
            I have really grown as a designer and researcher in the last few
            months and this project has been key to that. This is the first
            complete product I have originally designed from scratch and it was
            a very exciting journey. The tight budget really helped me think
            resourcefully and use what I have instead lol. Time to jump into the
            next one. Thank you for your time.
