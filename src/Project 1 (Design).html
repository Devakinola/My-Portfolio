        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="overview">
          Movies are a top choice for relaxation and entertainment. Movies
          affect many of us powerfully because the combined impact of images,
          music, dialogue, lighting, sound, and special effects can elicit deep
          feelings and help us reflect on our lives. Cinemas give us this
          experience in the most awesome way possible by providing HD screen
          quality, premium sounds, and SNACKS! Even when watching movies on our
          TVs and Laptops at home, movie snacks make the movie viewing
          experience more enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p class="overview">
          The queues to get snacks at concession lines are stressful and with
          the current pandemic going on, it is also very hard to practice social
          distancing when lots of people are gathering at a particular point.
          These long lines have even caused some people to miss part of their
          movie or they have to start the movie without snacks and return to get
          their snacks. These are all big-time mood killers.
        </p>
        <p class="overview">
          Imagine having to miss the iconic opening scene in Dark Knight because
          you were still stuck on the snack line.

        <h2>My Design Process</h2>
        <p class="overview">
          I utilize the design thinking framework because it provides a way to
          create solutions that address real user problems, are functional, and
          also affordable. It is also nonlinear so it provides great flexibility
          for me as a designer.

        <div>
          <h2>Empathize Phase</h2>
          <p class="overview">
            How can I claim to create a user-centered product if I don’t know
            what the users want? I carried extensive foundational research
            before even thinking of designing anything to answer questions like;
            what should I build? what are the user problems? and how can I solve
            them?
          </p>
          <p class="overview">
            I did some secondary research to get information on what products
            are out there solving similar problems I want to solve. This was a
            sort of competitive auditing to check out the competition so I can
            learn from and also improve on that product. Everyone loves to go to
            the movies, from teens to parents going with their kids. Working
            with a large demographic on such a tight budget was very tough too.
          </p>
          <h3>Primary Research - User Interviews</h3>
          <p class="overview">
            Empathy is a key part of UX research because it helps us designers
            understand someone else’s feelings or thoughts and it helps me get
            rid of cognitive BIAS in my research. I started my research with a
            screener survey shared through my social media accounts to help me
            identify potential participants that meet the requirements of my
            study.
          </p>
          <figure class="single-images">
            <img
              src="./assets/Munch/Screener image.png"

            />
            <figcaption>fig.2: Screenshot of screener survey</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p class="overview">
            After identifying and recruiting interview participants, I carried
            out user interviews remotely through the help of online calls and
            documented the results of my interview (i can't share for privacy
            reasons). Some common problems identified include snacks taking too
            long to prepare and snacks finishing too fast. I prioritized
            qualitative research for this project, unlike my last case study
            where I had more quantitative research. The reason for this is
            because I did not have a product (MVP even) at this point and I
            needed to know what users wanted and why?
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
          <p class="overview">
            After evaluating the results from my user interview, I was able to
            mentally sort my users into two different user groups and so I
            designed an aggregated empathy map to visually represent everything
            I have learned about these user groups.
          </p>

          <p class="overview">
            With these empathy maps, I was able to understand the goals and
            characteristics of these groups and create identities that represent
            the needs of a larger group of users. These are my……………………………

            job, she also loves to spend time with her family. She plans weekly
            family movie nights and getting snacks is usually a hassle for
            Chisom.

            defining my problem statement. Using the “5 Ws and H” method, I came

            Now that I have established our problem statements, I can kick off
